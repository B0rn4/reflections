What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Makes a hidden .git directory, making the files in the directory abovit "commitable".

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
You don't have to commit the whole directory, instead you can make a smaller selection that you put in the staging area. The value is letting you save logical changes.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
If you changed more than one file, you can move one to the staging area and commit, then move another and commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
When I want to incorporate changes that are experimental.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
All diagrams help you visualize.
