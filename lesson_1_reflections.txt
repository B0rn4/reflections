How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Don't have to search through long files manually. Less anxiety about mistakes. Perhaps I'll want to reintroduce a functionality from an old version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
You can forget to save manually, but manual saves allow you to save at logical times.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Cos git is made from programmers, and programmers often use file systems, not individual files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Cos I can always revert, duh.
